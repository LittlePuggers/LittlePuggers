### Hi there! I'm Ana Ibarra aka LittlePuggers! 👋

I started learning code with ✨freeCodeCamp✨ as a hobby, like sudokus and puzzle games 🤓  
It took me a while to realize I could dedicate myself to this 🤪 But I got there 😎  
I've been enjoying the wild ride of learning all these technologies and I hope it doesn't end soon! 🤩  
  
  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [BurgerQueen](https://github.com/LittlePuggers/DEV003-burger-queen-api-client) 🍔👑
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular, TypeScript, database mocks (JSON server)
- 💡 I recently was introduced to agile methodology and I'm loving it!
- 📫 You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anaibarram/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I picked my GitHub username for fun and now I'm attached to it 🙈
- 🐶 My pug supports me by snoring loudly by my side! 😂
